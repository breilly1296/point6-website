## Gaps Identified

### Missing Section Headers
1. Between "Sound familiar?" and Solutions cards: RESOLVED - "AI Starter Solutions" section header present
2. Between Solutions cards and Pricing: RESOLVED - "Transparent Pricing" section header present

### Content Gaps
1. OG image not yet created (TODO comment present in code)
2. Footer social links are placeholders (LinkedIn, YouTube)
3. Footer legal links are placeholders (Privacy, Terms)

---

## Issues Found

### Critical
1. None identified - page is complete and functional

### Major
1. **Placeholder links in footer**: LinkedIn, YouTube, Privacy, and Terms links all point to "#" - these need real URLs before launch

### Minor
1. **OG image TODO**: og-ai-launchpad.jpg needs to be created for social sharing
2. **Copyright year**: Shows 2025 - verify this is intentional
3. **External booking links**: All CTAs link to same Outlook booking page - consider tracking parameters to identify source (e.g., ?source=bronze-cta)

## Recommendations

1. **Add tracking to CTAs**: Consider adding UTM parameters or unique identifiers to the booking links to track which CTA drives the most conversions (e.g., `?source=hero`, `?source=bronze-tier`, etc.)

2. **Create OG image**: Design and add `og-ai-launchpad.jpg` (1200x630px) for optimal social media sharing

3. **Update footer links**: Replace placeholder # links for LinkedIn, YouTube, Privacy, and Terms with actual URLs before launch

4. **Consider testimonial/social proof**: Adding a brief testimonial or logo bar of clients who have used AI Launchpad could increase trust and conversion

5. **Add FAQ section**: Consider adding frequently asked questions about AI Launchpad to address common concerns and improve SEO

6. **Mobile testing**: Ensure all grid layouts (stats, solutions, pricing) stack appropriately on mobile devices
