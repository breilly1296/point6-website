## Issues Found

### Critical
None identified. The SEO implementation is comprehensive and well-executed.

### Major
1. **Missing OG Images**: All og:image and twitter:image references point to files that need to be created (marked as TODO in code)
2. **Missing Actual Images**: Team photos and founder photos are placeholders

### Minor
1. **Meta description slightly over 160 characters**: services.html (170 chars), results.html (165 chars), contact.html (168 chars) - consider trimming
2. **No author meta tag**: Not present on any page (optional but recommended)
3. **No LocalBusiness schema**: Consider adding for office locations
4. **No BreadcrumbList schema**: Could enhance search appearance for deeper pages
5. **Formspree form ID placeholder**: contact.html still has "YOUR_FORM_ID" placeholder
