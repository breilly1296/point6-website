- **Content summary**:
```
Founded in 2024, Point6 (formerly Mana'o Pili - Hawaiian for "connecting ideas") was built on a simple belief: organizations deserve ServiceNow partners who prioritize their success over billable hours.

After years at leading ServiceNow partners, our founders saw the same patterns: clients paying premium rates for junior resources, projects bogged down by bureaucracy, and solutions that didn't quite fit.

Point6 is different. We deliver flexible, high-quality ServiceNow expertise with a personal touch - combining the caliber of elite partners with the attention and value that only a focused team can provide.

The main gaps are visual assets (founder photos, team photo) and some placeholder links (Marcelino's LinkedIn, booking domain, footer social links). All factual information matches the CLAUDE.md specifications and the comparison table data is accurate. The team section, which was previously noted as blank, now contains meaningful role descriptions.
