### Section 2: Featured Case Study
- **Tag**: "Featured Case Study"
- **Industry**: "Financial Services"

**The Challenge**:
"A mid-size financial services company was struggling with their legacy ticketing system. Response times were slow, visibility was poor, and their IT team was drowning in manual processes. They needed a modern ITSM solution but had been burned by a failed implementation with another vendor."

**Our Approach**:
"We started with a focused discovery phase -- two weeks instead of the typical two months. We identified quick wins, mapped critical workflows, and built a phased rollout plan that prioritized adoption over features. Our senior consultants handled the implementation directly, with no handoffs to junior resources."

**Results**:
- 45% reduction in ticket resolution time
- 60% faster incident response
- $2M annual cost savings
