```
We started with a focused discovery phase — two weeks instead of the typical two months.

Our senior consultants handled the implementation directly, with no handoffs to junior resources.

## Issues Found

### Critical
1. None - all metrics have real values

### Major
1. **Testimonials are placeholders** - Section explicitly states "Real client testimonials coming soon" and uses `testimonial-placeholder` class
2. **Client logos missing** - Using emoji placeholders instead of actual logos or anonymized brand representations
3. **No inline testimonials** - Case studies lack client quotes within the case study itself

### Minor
1. **Footer links are placeholders** - LinkedIn, YouTube, Privacy, and Terms all link to "#"
2. **OG image not created** - TODO comment indicates og-results.jpg needs to be created
3. **Case study note repeated** - Anonymization note appears twice (once for featured, once for grid section)
4. **No project timeline** - Case studies don't indicate duration/timeline of engagements
5. **Copyright year** - Shows 2025, should be updated to 2026

---

## Recommendations

### Content Needed
1. **Real client testimonials** - Obtain permission from actual clients for quotes
2. **Client logos or anonymized visual identifiers** - Replace emoji placeholders with professional imagery
3. **Project timelines** - Add implementation duration to each case study (e.g., "12-week implementation")
4. **Inline quotes** - Add client quotes within each case study section for stronger credibility

### Assets Needed
1. **OG image** - Create og-results.jpg (1200x630px) with metrics/dashboard visualization
2. **Case study imagery** - Professional illustrations or anonymized project visuals
3. **Client avatars** - Photos or professional placeholder images for testimonials

### Suggested Improvements
1. Add a "View Full Case Study" link to each card if detailed case study pages are planned
2. Consider adding industry-specific icons instead of emojis
3. Add timeline badges (e.g., "Completed in 12 weeks")
4. Include a download option for case study PDFs
